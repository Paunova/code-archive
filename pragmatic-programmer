- Discuss "broken window" with your team

- Determine whether you're making stone soup (good) or frog soup (harm) when you try to catalyze change

- Consider the effect of modularization on the delivery of software. 
  Will it take more / less time to get a monolithic block of software to the required quality compared with a system designed in modules?
  
- Think of code evolution along the same lines as a box full of Schrodinger's cats: every decision results in a different version of the future. 
  How many possible futures can your code support? Which ones are more likely? How hard will it be to support them when the time comes? Dare you open the box?
